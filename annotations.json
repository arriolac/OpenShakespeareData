After pointing out the eternal damnation that he would be risking,\nnow Macbeth is also considering the consequences (the \"judgement\") that would\nalso occur on earth (\"here\") if he kills Duncan: the actions of a king (or\nanyone with lordship over others) in the feudal system, are not mere actions\nbut also lessons, examples (\"instructions\") for those lower than them in the\npyramid. If the lessons are \"bloody\" (and regicide was the ultimate example of\nthis), once taught, they can always come back to haunt the teacher\n(\"inventor\"). The justice of the world (in addition to eternal, divine\njustice) is blind (\"even-handed\") and if we put poison in a cup, it would\ninvariably send the cup back for us to drink from it. (Notice, Shakespeare\nwinking at his own plot device to resolve the conflcits in _Hamlet_ and\nprovide a rightful punishment for Claudius!)\n\n",

          "text": "In Shakespeare's own production of the play in 1611, the role of Prospero was\nplayed by 44-year-old Richard Burbage, but from the eighteenth century until\nthe mid-twentieth, Prospero was nearly always performed as a\u00a0grey and wizened\ngrandfather\u00a0and played by a much older man. In the late twentieth century, the\nrole began to be given to actors in their fourties who played Prospero as\nmiddle-aged.\n\nHow does Prospero's age affect the tone of the play? How does it affect his\nrelationship with Miranda? Some critics have argued that the middle-aged\nProspero harbors incestuous feelings for Miranda (feelings that were\u00a0absent in\nthe sexless old man of eighteenth century productions)\u00a0and that this emotional\ncurrent provides crucial motivation for his actions later in the play.\n\n",

Yet Claudius is more honest than he appears; that is, Hamlet is a\nthreat to Gertrude (the bedroom interview, anyone?) and to the state (can you\nimagine Hamlet at the helm of Denmark?). Shakespeare is a pretty good\nplaywright, and here he provides ample evidence of that by having the text\nspeak to us on three levels: a basic level (Claudius speaks and we listen); a\npsychological level (Claudius is clearly a lying, good-for-nothing throne-\nstealer and his motives are transparent); and a meta-level that transcends\ncharacter (Claudius may be deceiving Gertrude and himself, but he's also\nsaying something intelligible and instructive that the reader is made to\nconsider).\n\n",
