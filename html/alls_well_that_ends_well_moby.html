<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,
and LAFEU, all in black</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">COUNTESS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BERTRAM</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LAFEU</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,<br>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times<br>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose<br>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather<br>than lack it where there is such abundance.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">COUNTESS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LAFEU</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose<br>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and<br>finds no other advantage in the process but only the<br>losing of hope by time.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">COUNTESS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that<br>'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was<br>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so<br>far, would have made nature immortal, and death<br>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the<br>king's sake, he were living! I think it would be<br>the death of the king's disease.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LAFEU</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">How called you the man you speak of, madam?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">COUNTESS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was<br>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LAFEU</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very<br>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he<br>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge<br>could be set up against mortality.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LAFEU</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman<br>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">COUNTESS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my<br>overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that<br>her education promises; her dispositions she<br>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where<br>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there<br>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and<br>traitors too; in her they are the better for their<br>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LAFEU</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">COUNTESS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise<br>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches<br>her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all<br>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;<br>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect<br>a sorrow than have it.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HELENA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">O, were that all! I think not on my father;<br>And these great tears grace his remembrance more<br>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?<br>I have forgot him: my imagination<br>Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.<br>I am undone: there is no living, none,<br>If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one<br>That I should love a bright particular star<br>And think to wed it, he is so above me:<br>In his bright radiance and collateral light<br>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.<br>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:<br>The hind that would be mated by the lion<br>Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,<br>To see him every hour; to sit and draw<br>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,<br>In our heart's table; heart too capable<br>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:<br>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy<br>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?<br>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;<br>And yet I know him a notorious liar,<br>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;<br>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,<br>That they take place, when virtue's steely bones<br>Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see<br>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PAROLLES</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Are you meditating on virginity?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HELENA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me<br>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how<br>may we barricado it against him?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PAROLLES</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Keep him out.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HELENA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,<br>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some<br>warlike resistance.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PAROLLES</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">There is none: man, sitting down before you, will<br>undermine you and blow you up.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HELENA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Bless our poor virginity from underminers and<br>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how<br>virgins might blow up men?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PAROLLES</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be<br>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with<br>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It<br>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to<br>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational<br>increase and there was never virgin got till<br>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is<br>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost<br>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is<br>ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HELENA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PAROLLES</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the<br>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,<br>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible<br>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:<br>virginity murders itself and should be buried in<br>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate<br>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,<br>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very<br>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.<br>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of<br>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the<br>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose<br>by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make<br>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the<br>principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HELENA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PAROLLES</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it<br>likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with<br>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't<br>while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.<br>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out<br>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just<br>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not<br>now. Your date is better in your pie and your<br>porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,<br>your old virginity, is like one of our French<br>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,<br>'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;<br>marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HELENA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Not my virginity yet<br>There shall your master have a thousand loves,<br>A mother and a mistress and a friend,<br>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,<br>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,<br>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;<br>His humble ambition, proud humility,<br>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,<br>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world<br>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,<br>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--<br>I know not what he shall. God send him well!<br>The court's a learning place, and he is one--<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">

Be but your lordship<br>present at his examination: if he do not, for the<br>promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of<br>base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the<br>intelligence in his power against you, and that with<br>the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never<br>trust my judgment in any thing.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Lord</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BERTRAM</p>
