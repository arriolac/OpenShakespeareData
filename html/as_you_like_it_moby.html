<p class="shkspr-speech-body">As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion<br>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,<br>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his<br>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my<br>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and<br>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,<br>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more<br>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you<br>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that<br>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses<br>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair<br>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,<br>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his<br>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the<br>which his animals on his dunghills are as much<br>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so<br>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave<br>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets<br>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a<br>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my<br>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that<br>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I<br>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this<br>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I<br>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.<br></p>

She is at the court, and no<br>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and<br>never two ladies loved as they do.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and<br>a many merry men with him; and there they live like<br>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young<br>gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time<br>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">OLIVER</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CHARLES</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a<br>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand<br>that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition<br>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.<br>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that<br>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him<br>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,<br>for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I<br>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,<br>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you<br>withal, that either you might stay him from his<br>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall<br>run into, in that it is a thing of his own search<br>and altogether against my will.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">OLIVER</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which<br>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had<br>myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and<br>have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from<br>it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:<br>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full<br>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's<br>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against<br>me his natural brother: therefore use thy<br>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck<br>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if<br>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not<br>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise<br>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some<br>treacherous device and never leave thee till he<br>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;<br>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak<br>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this<br>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but<br>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must<br>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CHARLES</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come<br>to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go<br>alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and<br>so God keep your worship!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">OLIVER</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Farewell, good Charles.<br>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see<br>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,<br>hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never<br>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of<br>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much<br>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own<br>people, who best know him, that I am altogether<br>misprised: but it shall not be so long; this<br>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that<br>I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me<br>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to<br>woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish<br>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing<br>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,<br>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every<br>passion something and for no passion truly any<br>thing, as boys and women are for the most part<br>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe<br>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep<br>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor<br>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of<br>madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of<br>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.<br>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon<br>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's<br>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.<br></p>

If again 'it was<br>not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is<br>called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not<br>well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this<br>is called the Reproof Valiant.

All<br>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may<br>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven<br>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the<br>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but<br>of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and<br>they shook hands and swore brothers.
