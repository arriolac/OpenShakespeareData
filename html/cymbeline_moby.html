<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter two Gentlemen</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods<br>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers<br>Still seem as does the king.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">But what's the matter?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom<br>He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow<br>That late he married--hath referr'd herself<br>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;<br>Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all<br>Is outward sorrow; though I think the king<br>Be touch'd at very heart.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">None but the king?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,<br>That most desired the match; but not a courtier,<br>Although they wear their faces to the bent<br>Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not<br>Glad at the thing they scowl at.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">And why so?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing<br>Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--<br>I mean, that married her, alack, good man!<br>And therefore banish'd--is a creature such<br>As, to seek through the regions of the earth<br>For one his like, there would be something failing<br>In him that should compare. I do not think<br>So fair an outward and such stuff within<br>Endows a man but he.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You speak him far.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I do extend him, sir, within himself,<br>Crush him together rather than unfold<br>His measure duly.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What's his name and birth?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I cannot delve him to the root: his father<br>Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour<br>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,<br>But had his titles by Tenantius whom<br>He served with glory and admired success,<br>So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;<br>And had, besides this gentleman in question,<br>Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time<br>Died with their swords in hand; for which<br>their father,<br>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow<br>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,<br>Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased<br>As he was born. The king he takes the babe<br>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,<br>Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,<br>Puts to him all the learnings that his time<br>Could make him the receiver of; which he took,<br>As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,<br>And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--<br>Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,<br>A sample to the youngest, to the more mature<br>A glass that feated them, and to the graver<br>A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,<br>For whom he now is banish'd, her own price<br>Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;<br>By her election may be truly read<br>What kind of man he is.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I honour him<br>Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,<br>Is she sole child to the king?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">His only child.<br>He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,<br>Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,<br>I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery<br>Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge<br>Which way they went.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">That a king's children should be so convey'd,<br>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,<br>That could not trace them!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Howsoe'er 'tis strange,<br>Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,<br>Yet is it true, sir.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>

For you, Posthumus,<br>So soon as I can win the offended king,<br>I will be known your advocate: marry, yet<br>The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good<br>You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience<br>Your wisdom may inform you.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">IACHIMO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was<br>then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy<br>as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I<br>could then have looked on him without the help of<br>admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments<br>had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.<br></p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</p>

Come off, come off:<br>As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!<br>'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,<br>As strongly as the conscience does within,<br>To the madding of her lord. On her left breast<br>A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops<br>I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,<br>Stronger than ever law could make: this secret<br>Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en<br>The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?<br>Why should I write this down, that's riveted,<br>Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late<br>The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down<br>Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:<br>To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.<br>Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning<br>May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;<br>Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.<br>One, two, three: time, time!<br></p>

I am brought hither<br>Among the Italian gentry, and to fight<br>Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough<br>That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!<br>I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,<br>Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me<br>Of these Italian weeds and suit myself<br>As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight<br>Against the part I come with; so I'll die<br>For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life<br>Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,<br>Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril<br>Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know<br>More valour in me than my habits show.<br>Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!<br>To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin<br>The fashion, less without and more within.<br></p>
