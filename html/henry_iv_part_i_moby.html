<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL
of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">So shaken as we are, so wan with care,<br>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,<br>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils<br>To be commenced in strands afar remote.<br>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil<br>Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;<br>Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,<br>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs<br>Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,<br>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,<br>All of one nature, of one substance bred,<br>Did lately meet in the intestine shock<br>And furious close of civil butchery<br>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,<br>March all one way and be no more opposed<br>Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:<br>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,<br>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,<br>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,<br>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross<br>We are impressed and engaged to fight,<br>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;<br>Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb<br>To chase these pagans in those holy fields<br>Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet<br>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd<br>For our advantage on the bitter cross.<br>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,<br>And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:<br>Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear<br>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,<br>What yesternight our council did decree<br>In forwarding this dear expedience.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">My liege, this haste was hot in question,<br>And many limits of the charge set down<br>But yesternight: when all athwart there came<br>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;<br>Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,<br>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight<br>Against the irregular and wild Glendower,<br>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,<br>A thousand of his people butchered;<br>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,<br>Such beastly shameless transformation,<br>By those Welshwomen done as may not be<br>Without much shame retold or spoken of.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">It seems then that the tidings of this broil<br>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;<br>For more uneven and unwelcome news<br>Came from the north and thus it did import:<br>On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,<br>Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,<br>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,<br>At Holmedon met,<br>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,<br>As by discharge of their artillery,<br>And shape of likelihood, the news was told;<br>For he that brought them, in the very heat<br>And pride of their contention did take horse,<br>Uncertain of the issue any way.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,<br>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.<br>Stain'd with the variation of each soil<br>Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;<br>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.<br>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:<br>Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,<br>Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see<br>On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took<br>Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son<br>To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,<br>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:<br>And is not this an honourable spoil?<br>A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">In faith,<br>It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin<br>In envy that my Lord Northumberland<br>Should be the father to so blest a son,<br>A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;<br>Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;<br>Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:<br>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,<br>See riot and dishonour stain the brow<br>Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved<br>That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged<br>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,<br>And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!<br>Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.<br>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,<br>Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,<br>Which he in this adventure hath surprised,<br>To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,<br>I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,<br>Malevolent to you in all aspects;<br>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up<br>The crest of youth against your dignity.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">But I have sent for him to answer this;<br>And for this cause awhile we must neglect<br>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.<br>Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we<br>Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:<br>But come yourself with speed to us again;<br>For more is to be said and to be done<br>Than out of anger can be uttered.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I will, my liege.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Exeunt</p>
<h4 class="shkspr-scene-title">SCENE II.  London. An apartment of the Prince's.</h4>
<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack<br>and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon<br>benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to<br>demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.<br>What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the<br>day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes<br>capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the<br>signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself<br>a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no<br>reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand<br>the time of the day.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take<br>purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not<br>by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,<br>I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God<br>save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace<br>thou wilt have none,--<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What, none?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to<br>prologue to an egg and butter.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not<br>us that are squires of the night's body be called<br>thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's<br>foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the<br>moon; and let men say we be men of good government,<br>being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and<br>chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the<br>fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and<br>flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,<br>by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold<br>most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most<br>dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with<br>swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'<br>now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder<br>and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my<br>hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And<br>is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and<br>thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a<br>buff jerkin?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a<br>time and oft.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;<br>and where it would not, I have used my credit.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent<br>that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet<br>wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when<br>thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is<br>with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do<br>not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No; thou shalt.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have<br>the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my<br>humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell<br>you.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">For obtaining of suits?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman<br>hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy<br>as a gib cat or a lugged bear.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of<br>Moor-ditch?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed<br>the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young<br>prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more<br>with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a<br>commodity of good names were to be bought. An old<br>lord of the council rated me the other day in the<br>street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet<br>he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and<br>yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the<br>streets, and no man regards it.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able<br>to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon<br>me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew<br>thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man<br>should speak truly, little better than one of the<br>wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give<br>it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:<br>I'll be damned for never a king's son in<br>Christendom.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I<br>do not, call me villain and baffle me.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying<br>to purse-taking.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a<br>man to labour in his vocation.<br>Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a<br>match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what<br>hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the<br>most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to<br>a true man.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Good morrow, Ned.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">POINS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?<br>what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how<br>agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou<br>soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira<br>and a cold capon's leg?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have<br>his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of<br>proverbs: he will give the devil his due.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">POINS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">POINS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four<br>o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going<br>to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders<br>riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards<br>for you all; you have horses for yourselves:<br>Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke<br>supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it<br>as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff<br>your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry<br>at home and be hanged.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him<br>the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may<br>move and what he hears may be believed, that the<br>true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false<br>thief; for the poor abuses of the time want<br>countenance.

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>

Sirrah, I am sworn brother<br>to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by<br>their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.<br>They take it already upon their salvation, that<br>though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king<br>of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,<br>like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a<br>good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I<br>am king of England, I shall command all the good<br>lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing<br>scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they<br>cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I<br>am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,<br>that I can drink with any tinker in his own language<br>during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost<br>much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet<br>action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of<br>Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped<br>even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that<br>never spake other English in his life than 'Eight<br>shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with<br>this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint<br>of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to<br>drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,<br>do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my<br>puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do<br>thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale<br>to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and<br>I'll show thee a precedent.<br></p>

I pressed me none but such<br>toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no<br>bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out<br>their services; and now my whole charge consists of<br>ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of<br>companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the<br>painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his<br>sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but<br>discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to<br>younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers<br>trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a<br>long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than<br>an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up<br>the rooms of them that have bought out their<br>services, that you would think that I had a hundred<br>and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from<br>swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad<br>fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded<br>all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye<br>hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through<br>Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the<br>villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had<br>gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of<br>prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my<br>company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked<br>together and thrown over the shoulders like an<br>herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say<br>the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or<br>the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.

I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,<br>is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the<br>counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:<br>but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby<br>liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and<br>perfect image of life indeed. The better part of<br>valour is discretion; in the which better part I<br>have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this<br>gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he<br>should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am<br>afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.<br>Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I<br>killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?<br>Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.<br>Therefore, sirrah,<br>with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PRINCE HENRY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I did; I saw him dead,<br>Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art<br>thou alive?<br>Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?<br>I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes<br>Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.<br></p>

I grant you I was down and out of breath;<br>and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and<br>fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be<br>believed, so; if not, let them that should reward<br>valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take<br>it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the<br>thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,<br>'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.<br></p>
