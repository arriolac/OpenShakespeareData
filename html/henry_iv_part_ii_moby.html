<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">TRAVERS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back<br>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,<br>Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard<br>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,<br>That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.<br>He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him<br>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:<br>He told me that rebellion had bad luck<br>And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.<br>With that, he gave his able horse the head,<br>And bending forward struck his armed heels<br>Against the panting sides of his poor jade<br>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so<br>He seem'd in running to devour the way,<br>Staying no longer question.<br></p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MORTON</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.<br>I see a strange confession in thine eye:<br>Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin<br>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;<br>The tongue offends not that reports his death:<br>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,<br>Not he which says the dead is not alive.<br>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news<br>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue<br>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,<br>Remember'd tolling a departing friend.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MORTON</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I am sorry I should force you to believe<br>That which I would to God I had not seen;<br>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,<br>Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,<br>To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down<br>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,<br>From whence with life he never more sprung up.<br>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire<br>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,<br>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away<br>From the best temper'd courage in his troops;<br>For from his metal was his party steel'd;<br>Which once in him abated, all the rest<br>Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:<br>And as the thing that's heavy in itself,<br>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,<br>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,<br>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear<br>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim<br>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,<br>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester<br>Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,<br>The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword<br>Had three times slain the appearance of the king,<br>'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame<br>Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,<br>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all<br>Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out<br>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,<br>Under the conduct of young Lancaster<br>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</p>

Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!<br>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel<br>Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!<br>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head<br>Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.<br>Now bind my brows with iron; and approach<br>The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring<br>To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!<br>Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand<br>Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!<br>And let this world no longer be a stage<br>To feed contention in a lingering act;<br>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain<br>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set<br>On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,<br>And darkness be the burier of the dead!<br></p>

It was your presurmise,<br>That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:<br>You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,<br>More likely to fall in than to get o'er;<br>You were advised his flesh was capable<br>Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit<br>Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:<br>Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,<br>Though strongly apprehended, could restrain<br>The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,<br>Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,<br>More than that being which was like to be?<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy<br>water; but, for the party that owed it, he might<br>have more diseases than he knew for.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FALSTAFF</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the<br>brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not<br>able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more<br>than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only<br>witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other<br>men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that<br>hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the<br>prince put thee into my service for any other reason<br>than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.<br>Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn<br>in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never<br>manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you<br>neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and<br>send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--<br>the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is<br>not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in<br>the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his<br>cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is<br>a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis<br>not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a<br>face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence<br>out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had<br>writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He<br>may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,<br>I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about<br>the satin for my short cloak and my slops?<br></p>

The whoreson<br>smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and<br>bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is<br>through with them in honest taking up, then they<br>must stand upon security. I had as lief they would<br>put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with<br>security. I looked a' should have sent me two and<br>twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he<br>sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;<br>for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness<br>of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he<br>see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.<br>Where's Bardolph?<br></p>

But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better<br>than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when<br>thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done<br>a great while, because the rest of thy low<br>countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:<br>and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins<br>of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the<br>midwives say the children are not in the fault;<br>whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are<br>mightily strengthened.<br></p>

Here's Wart; you see what a<br>ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and<br>discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's<br>hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets<br>on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced<br>fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no<br>mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim<br>level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;<br>how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run<br>off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the<br>great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.<br>On, Bardolph; lead the men away.<br>As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do<br>see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how<br>subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This<br>same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to<br>me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he<br>hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third<br>word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's<br>tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a<br>man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'<br>was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked<br>radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it<br>with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his<br>dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'<br>was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a<br>monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came<br>ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those<br>tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the<br>carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or<br>his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger<br>become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a<br>Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and<br>I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the<br>Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding<br>among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a<br>Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have<br>thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the<br>case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a<br>court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll<br>be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall<br>go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two<br>stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the<br>old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I<br>may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than<br>your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-<br>blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make<br>him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.<br>There's never none of these demure boys come to any<br>proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,<br>and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a<br>kind of male green-sickness; and then when they<br>marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools<br>and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for<br>inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold<br>operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;<br>dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy<br>vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,<br>quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and<br>delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the<br>voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes<br>excellent wit. The second property of your<br>excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;<br>which, before cold and settled, left the liver<br>white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity<br>and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes<br>it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:<br>it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives<br>warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,<br>man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and<br>inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,<br>the heart, who, great and puffed up with this<br>retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour<br>comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is<br>nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and<br>learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till<br>sack commences it and sets it in act and use.<br>Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for<br>the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his<br>father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,<br>manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent<br>endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile<br>sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If<br>I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I<br>would teach them should be, to forswear thin<br>potations and to addict themselves to sack.<br>How now Bardolph?<br></p>

There is your crown;<br>And He that wears the crown immortally<br>Long guard it yours! If I affect it more<br>Than as your honour and as your renown,<br>Let me no more from this obedience rise,<br>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit<br>Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.<br>God witness with me, when I here came in,<br>And found no course of breath within your majesty,<br>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,<br>O, let me in my present wildness die<br>And never live to show the incredulous world<br>The noble change that I have purposed!<br>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,<br>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,<br>I spake unto this crown as having sense,<br>And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending<br>Hath fed upon the body of my father;<br>Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:<br>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,<br>Preserving life in medicine potable;<br>But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,<br>Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,<br>Accusing it, I put it on my head,<br>To try with it, as with an enemy<br>That had before my face murder'd my father,<br>The quarrel of a true inheritor.<br>But if it did infect my blood with joy,<br>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;<br>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine<br>Did with the least affection of a welcome<br>Give entertainment to the might of it,<br>Let God for ever keep it from my head<br>And make me as the poorest vassal is<br>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!<br></p>

God knows, my son,<br>By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways<br>I met this crown; and I myself know well<br>How troublesome it sat upon my head.<br>To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,<br>Better opinion, better confirmation;<br>For all the soil of the achievement goes<br>With me into the earth. It seem'd in me<br>But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,<br>And I had many living to upbraid<br>My gain of it by their assistances;<br>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,<br>Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears<br>Thou see'st with peril I have answered;<br>For all my reign hath been but as a scene<br>Acting that argument: and now my death<br>Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,<br>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;<br>So thou the garland wear'st successively.<br>Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,<br>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;<br>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,<br>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;<br>By whose fell working I was first advanced<br>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear<br>To be again displaced: which to avoid,<br>I cut them off; and had a purpose now<br>To lead out many to the Holy Land,<br>Lest rest and lying still might make them look<br>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,<br>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds<br>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,<br>May waste the memory of the former days.<br>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so<br>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.<br>How I came by the crown, O God forgive;<br>And grant it may with thee in true peace live!<br></p>

If I had a suit<br>to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the<br>imputation of being near their master: if to his<br>men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man<br>could better command his servants. It is certain<br>that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is<br>caught, as men take diseases, one of another:<br>therefore let men take heed of their company. I<br>will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to<br>keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing<br>out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two<br>actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,<br>it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest<br>with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never<br>had the ache in his shoulders!
