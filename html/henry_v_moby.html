<p class="shkspr-speech-body">My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,<br>Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign<br>Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,<br>But that the scambling and unquiet time<br>Did push it out of farther question.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CANTERBURY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">It must be thought on. If it pass against us,<br>We lose the better half of our possession:<br>For all the temporal lands which men devout<br>By testament have given to the church<br>Would they strip from us; being valued thus:<br>As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,<br>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,<br>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;<br>And, to relief of lazars and weak age,<br>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.<br>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;<br>And to the coffers of the king beside,<br>A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CANTERBURY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">The courses of his youth promised it not.<br>The breath no sooner left his father's body,<br>But that his wildness, mortified in him,<br>Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment<br>Consideration, like an angel, came<br>And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,<br>Leaving his body as a paradise,<br>To envelop and contain celestial spirits.<br>Never was such a sudden scholar made;<br>Never came reformation in a flood,<br>With such a heady currance, scouring faults<br>Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness<br>So soon did lose his seat and all at once<br>As in this king.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CANTERBURY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He seems indifferent,<br>Or rather swaying more upon our part<br>Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;<br>For I have made an offer to his majesty,<br>Upon our spiritual convocation<br>And in regard of causes now in hand,<br>Which I have open'd to his grace at large,<br>As touching France, to give a greater sum<br>Than ever at one time the clergy yet<br>Did to his predecessors part withal.<br></p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY V</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Sure, we thank you.<br>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed<br>And justly and religiously unfold<br>Why the law Salique that they have in France<br>Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:<br>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,<br>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,<br>Or nicely charge your understanding soul<br>With opening titles miscreate, whose right<br>Suits not in native colours with the truth;<br>For God doth know how many now in health<br>Shall drop their blood in approbation<br>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.<br>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,<br>How you awake our sleeping sword of war:<br>We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;<br>For never two such kingdoms did contend<br>Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops<br>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint<br>'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords<br>That make such waste in brief mortality.<br>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;<br>For we will hear, note and believe in heart<br>That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd<br>As pure as sin with baptism.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CANTERBURY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,<br>That owe yourselves, your lives and services<br>To this imperial throne. There is no bar<br>To make against your highness' claim to France<br>But this, which they produce from Pharamond,<br>'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'<br>'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'<br>Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze<br>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond<br>The founder of this law and female bar.<br>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm<br>That the land Salique is in Germany,<br>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;<br>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,<br>There left behind and settled certain French;<br>Who, holding in disdain the German women<br>For some dishonest manners of their life,<br>Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female<br>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:<br>Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,<br>Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.<br>Then doth it well appear that Salique law<br>Was not devised for the realm of France:<br>Nor did the French possess the Salique land<br>Until four hundred one and twenty years<br>After defunction of King Pharamond,<br>Idly supposed the founder of this law;<br>Who died within the year of our redemption<br>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great<br>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French<br>Beyond the river Sala, in the year<br>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,<br>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,<br>Did, as heir general, being descended<br>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,<br>Make claim and title to the crown of France.<br>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown<br>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male<br>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,<br>To find his title with some shows of truth,<br>'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,<br>Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,<br>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son<br>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son<br>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,<br>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,<br>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,<br>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied<br>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,<br>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,<br>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:<br>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great<br>Was re-united to the crown of France.<br>So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.<br>King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,<br>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear<br>To hold in right and title of the female:<br>So do the kings of France unto this day;<br>Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law<br>To bar your highness claiming from the female,<br>And rather choose to hide them in a net<br>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles<br>Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.<br></p>
</div>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,<br>But fear the main intendment of the Scot,<br>Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;<br>For you shall read that my great-grandfather<br>Never went with his forces into France<br>But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom<br>Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,<br>With ample and brim fulness of his force,<br>Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,<br>Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;<br>That England, being empty of defence,<br>Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CANTERBURY</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">But there's a saying very old and true,<br>'If that you will France win,<br>Then with Scotland first begin:'<br>For once the eagle England being in prey,<br>To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot<br>Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,<br>Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,<br>To tear and havoc more than she can eat.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">EXETER</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">It follows then the cat must stay at home:<br>Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,<br>Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,<br>And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.<br>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,<br>The advised head defends itself at home;<br>For government, though high and low and lower,<br>Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,<br>Congreeing in a full and natural close,<br>Like music.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CANTERBURY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Therefore doth heaven divide<br>The state of man in divers functions,<br>Setting endeavour in continual motion;<br>To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,<br>Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,<br>Creatures that by a rule in nature teach<br>The act of order to a peopled kingdom.<br>They have a king and officers of sorts;<br>Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,<br>Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,<br>Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,<br>Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,<br>Which pillage they with merry march bring home<br>To the tent-royal of their emperor;<br>Who, busied in his majesty, surveys<br>The singing masons building roofs of gold,<br>The civil citizens kneading up the honey,<br>The poor mechanic porters crowding in<br>Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,<br>The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,<br>Delivering o'er to executors pale<br>The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,<br>That many things, having full reference<br>To one consent, may work contrariously:<br>As many arrows, loosed several ways,<br>Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;<br>As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;<br>As many lines close in the dial's centre;<br>So may a thousand actions, once afoot.<br>End in one purpose, and be all well borne<br>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.<br>Divide your happy England into four;<br>Whereof take you one quarter into France,<br>And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.<br>If we, with thrice such powers left at home,<br>Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,<br>Let us be worried and our nation lose<br>The name of hardiness and policy.<br></p>

'How now,<br>sir John!' quoth I 'what, man! be o' good<br>cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or<br>four times.

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">As young as I am, I have observed these three<br>swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they<br>three, though they would serve me, could not be man<br>to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to<br>a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and<br>red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but<br>fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue<br>and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks<br>words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath<br>heard that men of few words are the best men; and<br>therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'<br>should be thought a coward: but his few bad words<br>are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never<br>broke any man's head but his own, and that was<br>against a post when he was drunk. They will steal<br>any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a<br>lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for<br>three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn<br>brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a<br>fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the<br>men would carry coals. They would have me as<br>familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their<br>handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,<br>if I should take from another's pocket to put into<br>mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I<br>must leave them, and seek some better service:<br>their villany goes against my weak stomach, and<br>therefore I must cast it up.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I<br>speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I<br>am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the<br>element shows to him as it doth to me; all his<br>senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies<br>laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and<br>though his affections are higher mounted than ours,<br>yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like<br>wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we<br>do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish<br>as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess<br>him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing<br>it, should dishearten his army.<br></p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">WILLIAMS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">That's more than we know.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BATES</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know<br>enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if<br>his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes<br>the crime of it out of us.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">WILLIAMS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath<br>a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and<br>arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join<br>together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at<br>such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a<br>surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind<br>them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their<br>children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die<br>well that die in a battle; for how can they<br>charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their<br>argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it<br>will be a black matter for the king that led them to<br>it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of<br>subjection.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY V</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">So, if a son that is by his father sent about<br>merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the<br>imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be<br>imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a<br>servant, under his master's command transporting a<br>sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in<br>many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the<br>business of the master the author of the servant's<br>damnation: but this is not so: the king is not<br>bound to answer the particular endings of his<br>soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of<br>his servant; for they purpose not their death, when<br>they purpose their services. Besides, there is no<br>king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to<br>the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all<br>unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them<br>the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;<br>some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of<br>perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that<br>have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with<br>pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have<br>defeated the law and outrun native punishment,<br>though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to<br>fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;<br>so that here men are punished for before-breach of<br>the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where<br>they feared the death, they have borne life away;<br>and where they would be safe, they perish: then if<br>they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of<br>their damnation than he was before guilty of those<br>impieties for the which they are now visited. Every<br>subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's<br>soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in<br>the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every<br>mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death<br>is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was<br>blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:<br>and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think<br>that, making God so free an offer, He let him<br>outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach<br>others how they should prepare.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,<br>Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am<br>glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if<br>thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king<br>that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my<br>crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but<br>directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me<br>farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out<br>my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so<br>clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY V</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for<br>your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I<br>have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I<br>have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable<br>measure in strength. If I could win a lady at<br>leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my<br>armour on my back, under the correction of bragging<br>be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.<br>Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse<br>for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and<br>sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,<br>Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my<br>eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;<br>only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,<br>nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a<br>fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth<br>sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love<br>of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy<br>cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst<br>love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee<br>that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the<br>Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou<br>livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and<br>uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee<br>right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other<br>places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that<br>can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do<br>always reason themselves out again. What! a<br>speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A<br>good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a<br>black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow<br>bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax<br>hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the<br>moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it<br>shines bright and never changes, but keeps his<br>course truly. If thou would have such a one, take<br>me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,<br>take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?<br>speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY V</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of<br>France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love<br>the friend of France; for I love France so well that<br>I will not part with a village of it; I will have it<br>all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am<br>yours, then yours is France and you are mine.<br></p>

Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand<br>vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what<br>then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est<br>France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,<br>Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much<br>more French: I shall never move thee in French,<br>unless it be to laugh at me.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask<br>them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,<br>when you come into your closet, you'll question this<br>gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to<br>her dispraise those parts in me that you love with<br>your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the<br>rather, gentle princess, because I love thee<br>cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a<br>saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get<br>thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs<br>prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,<br>between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a<br>boy, half French, half English, that shall go to<br>Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?<br>shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair<br>flower-de-luce?<br></p>

By mine honour, in<br>true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I<br>dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to<br>flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor<br>and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew<br>my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars<br>when he got me: therefore was I created with a<br>stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when<br>I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,<br>Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:<br>my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of<br>beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou<br>hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou<br>shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:<br>and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you<br>have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the<br>thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;<br>take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am<br>thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine<br>ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is<br>thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry<br>Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before<br>his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,<br>thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.<br>Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is<br>music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of<br>all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken<br>English; wilt thou have me?<br></p>
