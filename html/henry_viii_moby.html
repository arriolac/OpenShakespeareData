<h2>The Famous History of the Life of Henry the Eighth</h2><h3 class="shkspr-act-title">ACT I</h3><h4 class="shkspr-scene-title">SCENE I.  London. An ante-chamber in the palace.</h4>
<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM
and ABERGAVENNY</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done<br>Since last we saw in France?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I thank your grace,<br>Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer<br>Of what I saw there.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">An untimely ague<br>Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when<br>Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,<br>Met in the vale of Andren.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">'Twixt Guynes and Arde:<br>I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;<br>Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung<br>In their embracement, as they grew together;<br>Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd<br>Such a compounded one?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">All the whole time<br>I was my chamber's prisoner.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Then you lost<br>The view of earthly glory: men might say,<br>Till this time pomp was single, but now married<br>To one above itself. Each following day<br>Became the next day's master, till the last<br>Made former wonders its. To-day the French,<br>All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,<br>Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they<br>Made Britain India: every man that stood<br>Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were<br>As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,<br>Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear<br>The pride upon them, that their very labour<br>Was to them as a painting: now this masque<br>Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night<br>Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,<br>Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,<br>As presence did present them; him in eye,<br>Still him in praise: and, being present both<br>'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner<br>Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--<br>For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged<br>The noble spirits to arms, they did perform<br>Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,<br>Being now seen possible enough, got credit,<br>That Bevis was believed.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">O, you go far.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">As I belong to worship and affect<br>In honour honesty, the tract of every thing<br>Would by a good discourser lose some life,<br>Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;<br>To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.<br>Order gave each thing view; the office did<br>Distinctly his full function.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Who did guide,<br>I mean, who set the body and the limbs<br>Of this great sport together, as you guess?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">One, certes, that promises no element<br>In such a business.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I pray you, who, my lord?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">All this was order'd by the good discretion<br>Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed<br>From his ambitious finger. What had he<br>To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder<br>That such a keech can with his very bulk<br>Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun<br>And keep it from the earth.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Surely, sir,<br>There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;<br>For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace<br>Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon<br>For high feats done to the crown; neither allied<br>For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,<br>Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,<br>The force of his own merit makes his way<br>A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys<br>A place next to the king.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ABERGAVENNY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I cannot tell<br>What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye<br>Pierce into that; but I can see his pride<br>Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,<br>If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,<br>Or has given all before, and he begins<br>A new hell in himself.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why the devil,<br>Upon this French going out, took he upon him,<br>Without the privity o' the king, to appoint<br>Who should attend on him? He makes up the file<br>Of all the gentry; for the most part such<br>To whom as great a charge as little honour<br>He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,<br>The honourable board of council out,<br>Must fetch him in the papers.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ABERGAVENNY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I do know<br>Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have<br>By this so sickened their estates, that never<br>They shall abound as formerly.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">O, many<br>Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em<br>For this great journey. What did this vanity<br>But minister communication of<br>A most poor issue?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Grievingly I think,<br>The peace between the French and us not values<br>The cost that did conclude it.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Every man,<br>After the hideous storm that follow'd, was<br>A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke<br>Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,<br>Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded<br>The sudden breach on't.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Which is budded out;<br>For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd<br>Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ABERGAVENNY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Is it therefore<br>The ambassador is silenced?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Marry, is't.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ABERGAVENNY</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">A proper title of a peace; and purchased<br>At a superfluous rate!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why, all this business<br>Our reverend cardinal carried.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Like it your grace,<br>The state takes notice of the private difference<br>Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--<br>And take it from a heart that wishes towards you<br>Honour and plenteous safety--that you read<br>The cardinal's malice and his potency<br>Together; to consider further that<br>What his high hatred would effect wants not<br>A minister in his power. You know his nature,<br>That he's revengeful, and I know his sword<br>Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,<br>It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,<br>Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,<br>You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock<br>That I advise your shunning.<br></p>
</div>


<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,
certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with
papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his
eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full
of disdain</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CARDINAL WOLSEY</p>

<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I<br>Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best<br>Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book<br>Outworths a noble's blood.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What, are you chafed?<br>Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only<br>Which your disease requires.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I read in's looks<br>Matter against me; and his eye reviled<br>Me, as his abject object: at this instant<br>He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;<br>I'll follow and outstare him.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Stay, my lord,<br>And let your reason with your choler question<br>What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills<br>Requires slow pace at first: anger is like<br>A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,<br>Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England<br>Can advise me like you: be to yourself<br>As you would to your friend.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I'll to the king;<br>And from a mouth of honour quite cry down<br>This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim<br>There's difference in no persons.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Be advised;<br>Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot<br>That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,<br>By violent swiftness, that which we run at,<br>And lose by over-running. Know you not,<br>The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,<br>In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:<br>I say again, there is no English soul<br>More stronger to direct you than yourself,<br>If with the sap of reason you would quench,<br>Or but allay, the fire of passion.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Sir,<br>I am thankful to you; and I'll go along<br>By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,<br>Whom from the flow of gall I name not but<br>From sincere motions, by intelligence,<br>And proofs as clear as founts in July when<br>We see each grain of gravel, I do know<br>To be corrupt and treasonous.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Say not 'treasonous.'<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong<br>As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,<br>Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous<br>As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief<br>As able to perform't; his mind and place<br>Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--<br>Only to show his pomp as well in France<br>As here at home, suggests the king our master<br>To this last costly treaty, the interview,<br>That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass<br>Did break i' the rinsing.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Faith, and so it did.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BUCKINGHAM</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal<br>The articles o' the combination drew<br>As himself pleased; and they were ratified<br>As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end<br>As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal<br>Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,<br>Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--<br>Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy<br>To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,<br>Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--<br>For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came<br>To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:<br>His fears were, that the interview betwixt<br>England and France might, through their amity,<br>Breed him some prejudice; for from this league<br>Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily<br>Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--<br>Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor<br>Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted<br>Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,<br>And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,<br>That he would please to alter the king's course,<br>And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,<br>As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal<br>Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,<br>And for his own advantage.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NORFOLK</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I am solicited, not by a few,<br>And those of true condition, that your subjects<br>Are in great grievance: there have been commissions<br>Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart<br>Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,<br>My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches<br>Most bitterly on you, as putter on<br>Of these exactions, yet the king our master--<br>Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he<br>escapes not<br>Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks<br>The sides of loyalty, and almost appears<br>In loud rebellion.<br></p>

These exactions,<br>Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are<br>Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,<br>The back is sacrifice to the load.

</div>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I'll tell you in a little. The great duke<br>Came to the bar; where to his accusations<br>He pleaded still not guilty and alleged<br>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.<br>The king's attorney on the contrary<br>Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions<br>Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired<br>To have brought viva voce to his face:<br>At which appear'd against him his surveyor;<br>Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,<br>Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,<br>Hopkins, that made this mischief.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">The same.<br>All these accused him strongly; which he fain<br>Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:<br>And so his peers, upon this evidence,<br>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much<br>He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all<br>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">After all this, how did he bear himself?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">When he was brought again to the bar, to hear<br>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd<br>With such an agony, he sweat extremely,<br>And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:<br>But he fell to himself again, and sweetly<br>In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I do not think he fears death.<br></p>

Or which of your friends<br>Have I not strove to love, although I knew<br>He were mine enemy? what friend of mine<br>That had to him derived your anger, did I<br>Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice<br>He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind<br>That I have been your wife, in this obedience,<br>Upward of twenty years, and have been blest<br>With many children by you: if, in the course<br>And process of this time, you can report,<br>And prove it too, against mine honour aught,<br>My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,<br>Against your sacred person, in God's name,<br>Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt<br>Shut door upon me, and so give me up<br>To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,<br>The king, your father, was reputed for<br>A prince most prudent, of an excellent<br>And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,<br>My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one<br>The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many<br>A year before: it is not to be question'd<br>That they had gather'd a wise council to them<br>Of every realm, that did debate this business,<br>Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly<br>Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may<br>Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel<br>I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,<br>Your pleasure be fulfill'd!<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KING HENRY VIII</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">My lord cardinal,<br>I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,<br>I free you from't. You are not to be taught<br>That you have many enemies, that know not<br>Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,<br>Bark when their fellows do: by some of these<br>The queen is put in anger. You're excused:<br>But will you be more justified? You ever<br>Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired<br>It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,<br>The passages made toward it: on my honour,<br>I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,<br>And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,<br>I will be bold with time and your attention:<br>Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:<br>My conscience first received a tenderness,<br>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd<br>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;<br>Who had been hither sent on the debating<br>A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and<br>Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,<br>Ere a determinate resolution, he,<br>I mean the bishop, did require a respite;<br>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise<br>Whether our daughter were legitimate,<br>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,<br>Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook<br>The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,<br>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble<br>The region of my breast; which forced such way,<br>That many mazed considerings did throng<br>And press'd in with this caution. First, methought<br>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had<br>Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,<br>If it conceived a male child by me, should<br>Do no more offices of life to't than<br>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue<br>Or died where they were made, or shortly after<br>This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,<br>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,<br>Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not<br>Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that<br>I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in<br>By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me<br>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in<br>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer<br>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are<br>Now present here together: that's to say,<br>I meant to rectify my conscience,--which<br>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--<br>By all the reverend fathers of the land<br>And doctors learn'd: first I began in private<br>With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember<br>How under my oppression I did reek,<br>When I first moved you.<br></p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">As well as I am able. The rich stream<br>Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen<br>To a prepared place in the choir, fell off<br>A distance from her; while her grace sat down<br>To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,<br>In a rich chair of state, opposing freely<br>The beauty of her person to the people.<br>Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman<br>That ever lay by man: which when the people<br>Had the full view of, such a noise arose<br>As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,<br>As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--<br>Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces<br>Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy<br>I never saw before. Great-bellied women,<br>That had not half a week to go, like rams<br>In the old time of war, would shake the press,<br>And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living<br>Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven<br>So strangely in one piece.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">At length her grace rose, and with modest paces<br>Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like<br>Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.<br>Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:<br>When by the Archbishop of Canterbury<br>She had all the royal makings of a queen;<br>As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,<br>The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems<br>Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,<br>With all the choicest music of the kingdom,<br>Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,<br>And with the same full state paced back again<br>To York-place, where the feast is held.<br></p>

GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">How does your grace?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KATHARINE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">O Griffith, sick to death!<br>My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,<br>Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:<br>So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.<br>Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,<br>That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">GRIFFITH</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yes, madam; but I think your grace,<br>Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">GRIFFITH</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KATHARINE</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">GRIFFITH</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,<br>Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,<br>With all his covent, honourably received him;<br>To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,<br>An old man, broken with the storms of state,<br>Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;<br>Give him a little earth for charity!'<br>So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness<br>Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,<br>About the hour of eight, which he himself<br>Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,<br>Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,<br>He gave his honours to the world again,<br>His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KATHARINE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!<br>Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,<br>And yet with charity. He was a man<br>Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking<br>Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,<br>Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;<br>His own opinion was his law: i' the presence<br>He would say untruths; and be ever double<br>Both in his words and meaning: he was never,<br>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:<br>His promises were, as he then was, mighty;<br>But his performance, as he is now, nothing:<br>Of his own body he was ill, and gave<br>The clergy in example.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">GRIFFITH</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">GRIFFITH</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">This cardinal,<br>Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly<br>Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.<br>He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;<br>Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:<br>Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;<br>But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.<br>And though he were unsatisfied in getting,<br>Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,<br>He was most princely: ever witness for him<br>Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,<br>Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,<br>Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;<br>The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,<br>So excellent in art, and still so rising,<br>That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.<br>His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;<br>For then, and not till then, he felt himself,<br>And found the blessedness of being little:<br>And, to add greater honours to his age<br>Than man could give him, he died fearing God.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">KATHARINE</p>

Good Griffith,<br>Cause the musicians play me that sad note<br>I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating<br>On that celestial harmony I go to.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-stagedir">The vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after
another, six personages, clad in white robes,
wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden
vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in
their hands. They first congee unto her, then
dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold
a spare garland over her head; at which the other
four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held
the garland deliver the same to the other next two,
who observe the same order in their changes, and
holding the garland over her head: which done,
they deliver the same garland to the last two, who
likewise observe the same order: at which, as it
were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs
of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:
and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the
garland with them. The music continues</p>
