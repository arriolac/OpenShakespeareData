<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FLAVIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:<br>Is this a holiday? what! know you not,<br>Being mechanical, you ought not walk<br>Upon a labouring day without the sign<br>Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Commoner</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Commoner</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,<br>as you would say, a cobbler.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Commoner</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Commoner</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I<br>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's<br>matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon<br>to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I<br>recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon<br>neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.<br></p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MARULLUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?<br>What tributaries follow him to Rome,<br>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?<br>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!<br>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,<br>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft<br>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,<br>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,<br>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat<br>The livelong day, with patient expectation,<br>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:<br>And when you saw his chariot but appear,<br>Have you not made an universal shout,<br>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,<br>To hear the replication of your sounds<br>Made in her concave shores?<br>And do you now put on your best attire?<br>And do you now cull out a holiday?<br>And do you now strew flowers in his way<br>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!<br>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,<br>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague<br>That needs must light on this ingratitude.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FLAVIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,<br>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;<br>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears<br>Into the channel, till the lowest stream<br>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.<br>See whether their basest metal be not moved;<br>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.<br>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;<br>This way will I disrobe the images,<br>If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">MARULLUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">May we do so?<br>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">FLAVIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">It is no matter; let no images<br>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,<br>And drive away the vulgar from the streets:<br>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.<br>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing<br>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,<br>Who else would soar above the view of men<br>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I am not gamesome: I do lack some part<br>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.<br>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;<br>I'll leave you.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CASSIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Brutus, I do observe you now of late:<br>I have not from your eyes that gentleness<br>And show of love as I was wont to have:<br>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand<br>Over your friend that loves you.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Cassius,<br>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,<br>I turn the trouble of my countenance<br>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am<br>Of late with passions of some difference,<br>Conceptions only proper to myself,<br>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;<br>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--<br>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--<br>Nor construe any further my neglect,<br>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,<br>Forgets the shows of love to other men.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CASSIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;<br>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried<br>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.<br>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,<br>But by reflection, by some other things.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CASSIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">'Tis just:<br>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,<br>That you have no such mirrors as will turn<br>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,<br>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,<br>Where many of the best respect in Rome,<br>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus<br>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,<br>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CASSIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:<br>And since you know you cannot see yourself<br>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,<br>Will modestly discover to yourself<br>That of yourself which you yet know not of.<br>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:<br>Were I a common laugher, or did use<br>To stale with ordinary oaths my love<br>To every new protester; if you know<br>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard<br>And after scandal them, or if you know<br>That I profess myself in banqueting<br>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.<br></p>
</div>


<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Flourish, and shout</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CASSIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Ay, do you fear it?<br>Then must I think you would not have it so.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.<br>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?<br>What is it that you would impart to me?<br>If it be aught toward the general good,<br>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,<br>And I will look on both indifferently,<br>For let the gods so speed me as I love<br>The name of honour more than I fear death.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CASSIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,<br>As well as I do know your outward favour.<br>Well, honour is the subject of my story.<br>I cannot tell what you and other men<br>Think of this life; but, for my single self,<br>I had as lief not be as live to be<br>In awe of such a thing as I myself.<br>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:<br>We both have fed as well, and we can both<br>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:<br>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,<br>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,<br>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now<br>Leap in with me into this angry flood,<br>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,<br>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in<br>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.<br>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it<br>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside<br>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;<br>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,<br>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'<br>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,<br>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder<br>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<br>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man<br>Is now become a god, and Cassius is<br>A wretched creature and must bend his body,<br>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br>He had a fever when he was in Spain,<br>And when the fit was on him, I did mark<br>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;<br>His coward lips did from their colour fly,<br>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:<br>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans<br>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,<br>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'<br>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me<br>A man of such a feeble temper should<br>So get the start of the majestic world<br>And bear the palm alone.<br></p>
</div>


<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Shout. Flourish</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Another general shout!<br>I do believe that these applauses are<br>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CASSIUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<br>Like a Colossus, and we petty men<br>Walk under his huge legs and peep about<br>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.<br>Men at some time are masters of their fates:<br>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<br>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?<br>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?<br>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;<br>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;<br>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,<br>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.<br>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,<br>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,<br>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!<br>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!<br>When went there by an age, since the great flood,<br>But it was famed with more than with one man?<br>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,<br>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?<br>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,<br>When there is in it but one only man.<br>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,<br>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd<br>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome<br>As easily as a king.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;<br>What you would work me to, I have some aim:<br>How I have thought of this and of these times,<br>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,<br>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,<br>Be any further moved. What you have said<br>I will consider; what you have to say<br>I will with patience hear, and find a time<br>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.<br>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:<br>Brutus had rather be a villager<br>Than to repute himself a son of Rome<br>Under these hard conditions as this time<br>Is like to lay upon us.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CASSIUS</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BRUTUS</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:<br>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark<br>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown<br>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told<br>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my<br>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he<br>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:<br>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his<br>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third<br>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he<br>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their<br>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps<br>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because<br>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked<br>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and<br>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of<br>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CASCA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the<br>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he<br>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his<br>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any<br>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,<br>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so<br>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,<br>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired<br>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three<br>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good<br>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but<br>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had<br>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.<br></p>
