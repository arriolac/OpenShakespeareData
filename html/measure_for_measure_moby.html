Thou art not noble;<br>For all the accommodations that thou bear'st<br>Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;<br>For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork<br>Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,<br>And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st<br>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;<br>For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains<br>That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;<br>For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,<br>And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;<br>For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,<br>After the moon.

Friend hast thou none;<br>For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,<br>The mere effusion of thy proper loins,<br>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,<br>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,<br>But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,<br>Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth<br>Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms<br>Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,<br>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,<br>To make thy riches pleasant.

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DUKE VINCENTIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you<br>and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to<br>corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her<br>virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition<br>of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,<br>hath made him that gracious denial which he is most<br>glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I<br>know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to<br>death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes<br>that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to<br>your knees and make ready.<br></p>

The assault that Angelo hath made to you,<br>fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but<br>that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should<br>wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this<br>substitute, and to save your brother?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ISABELLA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my<br>brother die by the law than my son should be<br>unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke<br>deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can<br>speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or<br>discover his government.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DUKE VINCENTIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter<br>now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made<br>trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my<br>advisings: to the love I have in doing good a<br>remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe<br>that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged<br>lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from<br>the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious<br>person; and much please the absent duke, if<br>peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of<br>this business.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DUKE VINCENTIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">She should this Angelo have married; was affianced<br>to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between<br>which time of the contract and limit of the<br>solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,<br>having in that perished vessel the dowry of his<br>sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the<br>poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and<br>renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most<br>kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of<br>her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her<br>combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ISABELLA</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DUKE VINCENTIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them<br>with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,<br>pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,<br>bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet<br>wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,<br>is washed with them, but relents not.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ISABELLA</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DUKE VINCENTIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the<br>cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps<br>you from dishonour in doing it.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ISABELLA</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DUKE VINCENTIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance<br>of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that<br>in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,<br>like an impediment in the current, made it more<br>violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his<br>requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with<br>his demands to the point; only refer yourself to<br>this advantage, first, that your stay with him may<br>not be long; that the time may have all shadow and<br>silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.<br>This being granted in course,--and now follows<br>all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up<br>your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter<br>acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to<br>her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother<br>saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana<br>advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid<br>will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you<br>think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness<br>of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.<br>What think you of it?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ISABELLA</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DUKE VINCENTIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily<br>to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his<br>bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will<br>presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated<br>grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that<br>place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that<br>it may be quickly.<br></p>
