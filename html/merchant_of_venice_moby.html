<h2>The Merchant of Venice</h2><h3 class="shkspr-act-title">ACT I</h3><h4 class="shkspr-scene-title">SCENE I.  Venice. A street.</h4>
<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:<br>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;<br>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,<br>I am to learn;<br>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,<br>That I have much ado to know myself.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">SALARINO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<br>There, where your argosies with portly sail,<br>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,<br>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<br>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<br>As they fly by them with their woven wings.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">SALANIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<br>The better part of my affections would<br>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,<br>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;<br>And every object that might make me fear<br>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br>Would make me sad.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">SALARINO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">My wind cooling my broth<br>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.<br>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br>But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br>And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,<br>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs<br>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br>And see the holy edifice of stone,<br>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,<br>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br>And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<br>But tell not me; I know, Antonio<br>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,<br>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br>Upon the fortune of this present year:<br>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">SALARINO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why, then you are in love.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Fie, fie!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">SALARINO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,<br>Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy<br>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,<br>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,<br>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:<br>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes<br>And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,<br>And other of such vinegar aspect<br>That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,<br>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.<br></p>
</div>


<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,<br>Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:<br>We leave you now with better company.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">SALARINO</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Your worth is very dear in my regard.<br>I take it, your own business calls on you<br>And you embrace the occasion to depart.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">SALARINO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Good morrow, my good lords.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BASSANIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?<br>You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">SALARINO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LORENZO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,<br>We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,<br>I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.<br></p>
</div>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">GRATIANO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You look not well, Signior Antonio;<br>You have too much respect upon the world:<br>They lose it that do buy it with much care:<br>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;<br>A stage where every man must play a part,<br>And mine a sad one.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">GRATIANO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Let me play the fool:<br>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,<br>And let my liver rather heat with wine<br>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.<br>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,<br>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?<br>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice<br>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--<br>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--<br>There are a sort of men whose visages<br>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,<br>And do a wilful stillness entertain,<br>With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion<br>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,<br>As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,<br>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'<br>O my Antonio, I do know of these<br>That therefore only are reputed wise<br>For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,<br>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,<br>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.<br>I'll tell thee more of this another time:<br>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,<br>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.<br>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:<br>I'll end my exhortation after dinner.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LORENZO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:<br>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,<br>For Gratiano never lets me speak.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">GRATIANO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, keep me company but two years moe,<br>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">GRATIANO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable<br>In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.<br></p>
</div>


<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Is that any thing now?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BASSANIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more<br>than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two<br>grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you<br>shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you<br>have them, they are not worth the search.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, tell me now what lady is the same<br>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,<br>That you to-day promised to tell me of?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BASSANIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,<br>How much I have disabled mine estate,<br>By something showing a more swelling port<br>Than my faint means would grant continuance:<br>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged<br>From such a noble rate; but my chief care<br>Is to come fairly off from the great debts<br>Wherein my time something too prodigal<br>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,<br>I owe the most, in money and in love,<br>And from your love I have a warranty<br>To unburden all my plots and purposes<br>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;<br>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,<br>Within the eye of honour, be assured,<br>My purse, my person, my extremest means,<br>Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BASSANIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,<br>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight<br>The self-same way with more advised watch,<br>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both<br>I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,<br>Because what follows is pure innocence.<br>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,<br>That which I owe is lost; but if you please<br>To shoot another arrow that self way<br>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br>As I will watch the aim, or to find both<br>Or bring your latter hazard back again<br>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You know me well, and herein spend but time<br>To wind about my love with circumstance;<br>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong<br>In making question of my uttermost<br>Than if you had made waste of all I have:<br>Then do but say to me what I should do<br>That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br>And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BASSANIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">In Belmont is a lady richly left;<br>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,<br>Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes<br>I did receive fair speechless messages:<br>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued<br>To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:<br>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<br>For the four winds blow in from every coast<br>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks<br>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;<br>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,<br>And many Jasons come in quest of her.<br>O my Antonio, had I but the means<br>To hold a rival place with one of them,<br>I have a mind presages me such thrift,<br>That I should questionless be fortunate!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ANTONIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;<br>Neither have I money nor commodity<br>To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;<br>Try what my credit can in Venice do:<br>That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,<br>To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.<br>Go, presently inquire, and so will I,<br>Where money is, and I no question make<br>To have it of my trust or for my sake.<br></p>
</div>


<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Exeunt</p>
<h4 class="shkspr-scene-title">SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</h4>
<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of<br>this great world.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in<br>the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and<br>yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit<br>with too much as they that starve with nothing. It<br>is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the<br>mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but<br>competency lives longer.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Good sentences and well pronounced.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">They would be better, if well followed.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">If to do were as easy as to know what were good to<br>do, chapels had been churches and poor men's<br>cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that<br>follows his own instructions: I can easier teach<br>twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the<br>twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may<br>devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps<br>o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the<br>youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the<br>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to<br>choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may<br>neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I<br>dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed<br>by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,<br>Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their<br>death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,<br>that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,<br>silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning<br>chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any<br>rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what<br>warmth is there in your affection towards any of<br>these princely suitors that are already come?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest<br>them, I will describe them; and, according to my<br>description, level at my affection.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">First, there is the Neapolitan prince.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but<br>talk of his horse; and he makes it a great<br>appropriation to his own good parts, that he can<br>shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his<br>mother played false with a smith.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Then there is the County Palatine.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you<br>will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and<br>smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping<br>philosopher when he grows old, being so full of<br>unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be<br>married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth<br>than to either of these. God defend me from these<br>two!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.<br>In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,<br>he! why, he hath a horse better than the<br>Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than<br>the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a<br>throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will<br>fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I<br>should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me<br>I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I<br>shall never requite him.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron<br>of England?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You know I say nothing to him, for he understands<br>not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,<br>nor Italian, and you will come into the court and<br>swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.<br>He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can<br>converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!<br>I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round<br>hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his<br>behavior every where.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he<br>borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and<br>swore he would pay him again when he was able: I<br>think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed<br>under for another.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and<br>most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when<br>he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and<br>when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:<br>and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall<br>make shift to go without him.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">If he should offer to choose, and choose the right<br>casket, you should refuse to perform your father's<br>will, if you should refuse to accept him.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a<br>deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,<br>for if the devil be within and that temptation<br>without, I know he will choose it. I will do any<br>thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You need not fear, lady, the having any of these<br>lords: they have acquainted me with their<br>determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their<br>home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless<br>you may be won by some other sort than your father's<br>imposition depending on the caskets.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as<br>chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner<br>of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers<br>are so reasonable, for there is not one among them<br>but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant<br>them a fair departure.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a<br>Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither<br>in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">NERISSA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish<br>eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of<br>thy praise.<br>How now! what news?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take<br>their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a<br>fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the<br>prince his master will be here to-night.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PORTIA</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a<br>heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should<br>be glad of his approach: if he have the condition<br>of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had<br>rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,<br>Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.<br>Whiles we shut the gates<br>upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.<br></p>

If we are like you in the rest, we will<br>resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,<br>what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian<br>wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by<br>Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you<br>teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I<br>will better the instruction.<br></p>

I could teach you<br>How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;<br>So will I never be: so may you miss me;<br>But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,<br>That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,<br>They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;<br>One half of me is yours, the other half yours,<br>Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,<br>And so all yours. O, these naughty times<br>Put bars between the owners and their rights!<br>And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,<br>Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.<br>I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,<br>To eke it and to draw it out in length,<br>To stay you from election.<br></p>

Then music is<br>Even as the flourish when true subjects bow<br>To a new-crowned monarch: such it is<br>As are those dulcet sounds in break of day<br>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,<br>And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,<br>With no less presence, but with much more love,<br>Than young Alcides, when he did redeem<br>The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy<br>To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice<br>The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,<br>With bleared visages, come forth to view<br>The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!<br>Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay<br>I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.<br>Tell me where is fancy bred,<br>Or in the heart, or in the head?<br>How begot, how nourished?<br>Reply, reply.<br>It is engender'd in the eyes,<br>With gazing fed; and fancy dies<br>In the cradle where it lies.<br>Let us all ring fancy's knell<br>I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.<br></p>

In religion,<br>What damned error, but some sober brow<br>Will bless it and approve it with a text,<br>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?<br>There is no vice so simple but assumes<br>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:<br>How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false<br>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins<br>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;<br>Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;<br>And these assume but valour's excrement<br>To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,<br>And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;<br>Which therein works a miracle in nature,<br>Making them lightest that wear most of it:<br>So are those crisped snaky golden locks<br>Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,<br>Upon supposed fairness, often known<br>To be the dowry of a second head,<br>The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.<br>Thus ornament is but the guiled shore<br>To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf<br>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,<br>The seeming truth which cunning times put on<br>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,<br>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;<br>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge<br>'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,<br>Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,<br>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;<br>And here choose I; joy be the consequence!<br></p>

Here's the scroll,<br>The continent and summary of my fortune.<br>You that choose not by the view,<br>Chance as fair and choose as true!<br>Since this fortune falls to you,<br>Be content and seek no new,<br>If you be well pleased with this<br>And hold your fortune for your bliss,<br>Turn you where your lady is<br>And claim her with a loving kiss.<br>A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;<br>I come by note, to give and to receive.<br>Like one of two contending in a prize,<br>That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,<br>Hearing applause and universal shout,<br>Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt<br>Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;<br>So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;<br>As doubtful whether what I see be true,<br>Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.<br></p>
