But<br>mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs<br>of three several deaths; first, an intolerable<br>fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten<br>bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good<br>bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to<br>point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,<br>like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes<br>that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a<br>man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject<br>to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution<br>and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.<br>And in the height of this bath, when I was more than<br>half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be<br>thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,<br>in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of<br>that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.<br></p>
