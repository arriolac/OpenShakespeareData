<h2>Much Ado about Nothing</h2><h3 class="shkspr-act-title">ACT I</h3><h4 class="shkspr-scene-title">SCENE I.  Before LEONATO'S house.</h4>
<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a
Messenger</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon<br>comes this night to Messina.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off<br>when I left him.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">But few of any sort, and none of name.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings<br>home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath<br>bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by<br>Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the<br>promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,<br>the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better<br>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to<br>tell you how.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much<br>glad of it.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I have already delivered him letters, and there<br>appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could<br>not show itself modest enough without a badge of<br>bitterness.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Did he break out into tears?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">In great measure.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces<br>truer than those that are so washed. How much<br>better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the<br>wars or no?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I know none of that name, lady: there was none such<br>in the army of any sort.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What is he that you ask for, niece?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">HERO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged<br>Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading<br>the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged<br>him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he<br>killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath<br>he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;<br>but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:<br>he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an<br>excellent stomach.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">And a good soldier too, lady.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all<br>honourable virtues.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:<br>but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a<br>kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:<br>they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit<br>between them.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last<br>conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and<br>now is the whole man governed with one: so that if<br>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him<br>bear it for a difference between himself and his<br>horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,<br>to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his<br>companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Is't possible?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as<br>the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the<br>next block.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray<br>you, who is his companion? Is there no young<br>squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he<br>is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker<br>runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if<br>he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a<br>thousand pound ere a' be cured.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I will hold friends with you, lady.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Do, good friend.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You will never run mad, niece.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No, not till a hot January.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Don Pedro is approached.<br></p>
</div>


<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,
and BALTHASAR</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DON PEDRO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your<br>trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid<br>cost, and you encounter it.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of<br>your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should<br>remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides<br>and happiness takes his leave.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DON PEDRO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this<br>is your daughter.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Her mother hath many times told me so.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DON PEDRO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this<br>what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers<br>herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an<br>honourable father.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not<br>have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as<br>like him as she is.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior<br>Benedick: nobody marks you.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Is it possible disdain should die while she hath<br>such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?<br>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come<br>in her presence.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I<br>am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I<br>would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard<br>heart; for, truly, I love none.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">A dear happiness to women: they would else have<br>been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God<br>and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I<br>had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man<br>swear he loves me.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some<br>gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate<br>scratched face.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such<br>a face as yours were.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and<br>so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's<br>name; I have done.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BEATRICE</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DON PEDRO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio<br>and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath<br>invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at<br>the least a month; and he heartily prays some<br>occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no<br>hypocrite, but prays from his heart.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.<br>Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to<br>the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DON JOHN</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank<br>you.<br></p>
</div>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">LEONATO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Please it your grace lead on?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">DON PEDRO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.<br></p>
</div>


<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CLAUDIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I noted her not; but I looked on her.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CLAUDIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Is she not a modest young lady?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for<br>my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak<br>after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CLAUDIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high<br>praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little<br>for a great praise: only this commendation I can<br>afford her, that were she other than she is, she<br>were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I<br>do not like her.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CLAUDIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me<br>truly how thou likest her.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?<br></p>
</div>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CLAUDIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Can the world buy such a jewel?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this<br>with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,<br>to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a<br>rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take<br>you, to go in the song?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CLAUDIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I<br>looked on.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such<br>matter: there's her cousin, an she were not<br>possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty<br>as the first of May doth the last of December. But I<br>hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CLAUDIO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the<br>contrary, if Hero would be my wife.<br></p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">BENEDICK</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world<br>one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?<br>Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?<br>Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck<br>into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away<br>Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:<br>but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go<br>dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of<br>Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior<br>Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of<br>affection the one with the other. I would fain have<br>it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if<br>you three will but minister such assistance as I<br>shall give you direction.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that<br>I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble<br>strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I<br>will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she<br>shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your<br>two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in<br>despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he<br>shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,<br>Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be<br>ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,<br>and I will tell you my drift.<br></p>

They will scarcely believe this without trial:<br>offer them instances; which shall bear no less<br>likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,<br>hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me<br>Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night<br>before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I<br>will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be<br>absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth<br>of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called<br>assurance and all the preparation overthrown.<br></p>

I have known when there was no music<br>with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he<br>rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known<br>when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a<br>good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,<br>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to<br>speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man<br>and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his<br>words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many<br>strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with<br>these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not<br>be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but<br>I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster<br>of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman<br>is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am<br>well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all<br>graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in<br>my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,<br>or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;<br>fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not<br>near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good<br>discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall<br>be of what colour it please God.

  This can be no trick: the<br>conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of<br>this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it<br>seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!<br>why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:<br>they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive<br>the love come from her; they say too that she will<br>rather die than give any sign of affection. I did<br>never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy<br>are they that hear their detractions and can put<br>them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a<br>truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis<br>so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving<br>me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor<br>no great argument of her folly, for I will be<br>horribly in love with her. I may chance have some<br>odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,<br>because I have railed so long against marriage: but<br>doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat<br>in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.<br>Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of<br>the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?<br>No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would<br>die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I<br>were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!<br>she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in<br>her.<br></p>
