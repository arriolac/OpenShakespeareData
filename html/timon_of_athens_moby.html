O you gods, think I, what need we have any<br>friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they<br>were the most needless creatures living, should we<br>ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble<br>sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their<br>sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished<br>myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We<br>are born to do benefits: and what better or<br>properer can we can our own than the riches of our<br>friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have<br>so many, like brothers, commanding one another's<br>fortunes!

What is this?<br>Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:<br>Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.<br>Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb<br>I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:<br>Our captain hath in every figure skill,<br>An aged interpreter, though young in days:<br>Before proud Athens he's set down by this,<br>Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.<br></p>
