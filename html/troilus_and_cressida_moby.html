<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">TROILUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,<br>Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;<br>But I am weaker than a woman's tear,<br>Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,<br>Less valiant than the virgin in the night<br>And skilless as unpractised infancy.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PANDARUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,<br>I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will<br>have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word<br>'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the<br>heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must<br>stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--<br>When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,<br>Reply not in how many fathoms deep<br>They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad<br>In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'<br>Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart<br>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,<br>Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,<br>In whose comparison all whites are ink,<br>Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure<br>The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense<br>Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,<br>As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;<br>But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,<br>Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me<br>The knife that made it.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">PANDARUS</p>

Why then, you princes,<br>Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,<br>And call them shames? which are indeed nought else<br>But the protractive trials of great Jove<br>To find persistive constancy in men:<br>The fineness of which metal is not found<br>In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,<br>The wise and fool, the artist and unread,<br>The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:<br>But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,<br>Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,<br>Puffing at all, winnows the light away;<br>And what hath mass or matter, by itself<br>Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.<br></p>

Either to harbour fled,<br>Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so<br>Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide<br>In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness<br>The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze<br>Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind<br>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,<br>And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage<br>As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,<br>And with an accent tuned in selfsame key<br>Retorts to chiding fortune.<br></p>
