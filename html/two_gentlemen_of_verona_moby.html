You were<br>wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you<br>walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you<br>fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you<br>looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you<br>are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look<br>on you, I can hardly think you my master.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,<br>look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a<br>puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or<br>four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.<br>I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,<br>'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver<br>him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;<br>and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he<br>steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:<br>O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself<br>in all companies! I would have, as one should say,<br>one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,<br>as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had<br>more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,<br>I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I<br>live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He<br>thrusts me himself into the company of three or four<br>gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had<br>not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but<br>all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says<br>one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him<br>out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.<br>I, having been acquainted with the smell before,<br>knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that<br>whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip<br>the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him<br>the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you<br>wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out<br>of the chamber. How many masters would do this for<br>his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the<br>stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had<br>been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese<br>he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.<br>Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the<br>trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam<br>Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I<br>do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make<br>water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst<br>thou ever see me do such a trick?<br></p>
