<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on<br>the like occasion whereon my services are now on<br>foot, you shall see, as I have said, great<br>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:<br>we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know<br>not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,<br>that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,<br>may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse<br>us.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.<br>They were trained together in their childhoods; and<br>there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,<br>which cannot choose but branch now. Since their<br>more mature dignities and royal necessities made<br>separation of their society, their encounters,<br>though not personal, have been royally attorneyed<br>with interchange of gifts, letters, loving<br>embassies; that they have seemed to be together,<br>though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and<br>embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed<br>winds. The heavens continue their loves!<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CAMILLO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it<br>is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the<br>subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on<br>crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to<br>see him a man.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">CAMILLO</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should<br>desire to live.<br></p>

My clown, who wants but something to<br>be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the<br>wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes<br>till he had both tune and words; which so drew the<br>rest of the herd to me that all their other senses<br>stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it<br>was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a<br>purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in<br>chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,<br>and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this<br>time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their<br>festival purses; and had not the old man come in<br>with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's<br>son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not<br>left a purse alive in the whole army.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-stagedir">Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman</p>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">AUTOLYCUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old<br>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:<br>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all<br>commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I<br>heard the shepherd say, he found the child.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">AUTOLYCUS</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I would most gladly know the issue of it.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I make a broken delivery of the business; but the<br>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were<br>very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with<br>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their<br>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language<br>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard<br>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable<br>passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest<br>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not<br>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the<br>extremity of the one, it must needs be.<br>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.<br>The news, Rogero?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the<br>king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is<br>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers<br>cannot be able to express it.<br>Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can<br>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news<br>which is called true is so like an old tale, that<br>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king<br>found his heir?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by<br>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you<br>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle<br>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,<br>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they<br>know to be his character, the majesty of the<br>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection<br>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,<br>and many other evidences proclaim her with all<br>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see<br>the meeting of the two kings?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,<br>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one<br>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it<br>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their<br>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,<br>holding up of hands, with countenances of such<br>distraction that they were to be known by garment,<br>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of<br>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that<br>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,<br>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then<br>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his<br>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old<br>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten<br>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such<br>another encounter, which lames report to follow it<br>and undoes description to do it.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried<br>hence the child?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Like an old tale still, which will have matter to<br>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear<br>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this<br>avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his<br>innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a<br>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">What became of his bark and his followers?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and<br>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the<br>instruments which aided to expose the child were<br>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble<br>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in<br>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of<br>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was<br>fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,<br>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin<br>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger<br>of losing.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">The dignity of this act was worth the audience of<br>kings and princes; for by such was it acted.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">One of the prettiest touches of all and that which<br>angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not<br>the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's<br>death, with the manner how she came to't bravely<br>confessed and lamented by the king, how<br>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one<br>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'<br>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my<br>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed<br>colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world<br>could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>

</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,<br>which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many<br>years in doing and now newly performed by that rare<br>Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself<br>eternity and could put breath into his work, would<br>beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her<br>ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that<br>they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of<br>answer: thither with all greediness of affection<br>are they gone, and there they intend to sup.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">I thought she had some great matter there in hand;<br>for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever<br>since the death of Hermione, visited that removed<br>house. Shall we thither and with our company piece<br>the rejoicing?<br></p>
</div>

<div class="shkspr-speech">
<p class="shkspr-speech-speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?<br>every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:<br>our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.<br>Let's along.<br></p>

<p class="shkspr-speech-body">Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,<br>would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old<br>man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard<br>them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he<br>at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,<br>so he then took her to be, who began to be much<br>sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of<br>weather continuing, this mystery remained<br>undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I<br>been the finder out of this secret, it would not<br>have relished among my other discredits.<br>Here come those I have done good to against my will,<br>and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.<br></p>

Thou hast found mine;<br>But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,<br>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many<br>A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--<br>For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee<br>An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,<br>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty<br>Is richly noted and here justified<br>By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.<br>What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,<br>That e'er I put between your holy looks<br>My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,<br>And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,<br>Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,<br>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely<br>Each one demand an answer to his part<br>Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first<br>We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.<br></p>
